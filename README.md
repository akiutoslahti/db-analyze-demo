This is my take on Dream Broker [Code Challenge programming assignment](https://challenge.dreambroker.jobs/245768c7-b82f-4a77-abbc-d1214acf7163).  

I chose Java 8 and Spring Boot platform as my choice of technology as I had previously programmed backend code only with node.js and wanted to check under the hood of Spring Boot.

Application is fully tested with JUnit and uses Travis CI to produce test coverage reports and automatic deploy to Heroku. Google Java Checkstyle was used for code formatting purposes.
